I've been developed several SOAP and REST web services applications in the past. I know pretty well of how to develop a 
web services application using either SOAP or REST approach. Recently, someone asked me why I choose this approach over 
another. It gave me a pause. So I did thorough research on the web before writing this.

Let's tell a little background of both technologies before going into the reasons of choosing which approach for application.

*SOAP*
SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) was developed by Microsoft for the purpose of replacing older web technologies DCOM 
(Distributed Component Object Model) and COBRA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) that didn't work well on Internet.
